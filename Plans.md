### Mod Data Saving System (Status: Planned)
- Allows for the saving of mod related data that can't be included in The Sims 4 saves.
- Save files will probably be loaded by one relatively simple module then handed off to category specific modules for managing.
- The category modules for saving will likely handle data specific to the world, sims, or lots.
- Data will also be separated based on what mod asked for it to be saved, so as not to inadvertently interfere with other mods.

### Sim Configuration System (Status: Planned)
- Will be very similar the system already in place for mod configuration except it will each sim will have their own setup.

### Object finder For Interactions (Status: Idea)
- Find all objects of a type specified by the interaction's tuning and add the interaction to it.
- Examples of object types you could set the interaction to would be all beds or all computers and more.
- This system could potentially allow for the support of new content with out updating mods, and support for custom content automatically.
