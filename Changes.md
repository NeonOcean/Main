## v1.1.0 (March 26, 2019)
During the development of this version I realized that it might be a good idea to open this mod up from being a toolkit for just my mods, to being a toolkit for potentially many mods. Some of the largest changes made reflect this.
 
- The names and paths of mods supposed to be loaded by Main are no longer hard coded, it will instead look through the mod folder for supporting mods.
- Mod information is now stored in a single JSON file, These files are also required for Main to detect or load the mod.
- A new system for handling settings is now in place.	
- Added tools for interactions, for example, interactions using Main can specify which objects they would like to be available on through tuning.
- New tools for in-game settings dialogs now allow a mod's settings to be changed far more easily.
- In-game notifications will now appear telling you when an update is available or to display promotions from NeonOcean.
- Interactions now exist that can direct you to web pages relevant to this mod, such as the documentation.
- Addition and removal of this mod are can now be facilitated through an installer or uninstaller. These currently are only usable on windows computers.
